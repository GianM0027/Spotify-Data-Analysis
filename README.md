# Spotify Project

This repository contains a personal project for analyzing your complete Spotify listening history.  

Currently, only a few features are implemented, but more will be added soon!

## How to Use  

1. Request your Spotify data from [this page](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/).
2. Download both:  
   - **Account data**
   - **Extended streaming history** (this may take some time)
3. You will likely receive them as `my_spotify_data.zip`. Donâ€™t worry about the file namesâ€”simply place both ZIP files inside the **`data_to_analyze`** folder. The code will handle the rest.  
4. Open and run the provided notebook.  

Thatâ€™s it! You can now explore your all-time Spotify data. ðŸŽ§
